# Bolbometopon_muricatum_kernel_fitting
Methods for fitting dispersal kernels to genetic parentage assignments for B. muricatum

These functions created the dispersal kernel fits found in:

Hamilton, R. et al. (2021). "Larval dispersal and fishing pressure influence recruitment in a coral reef fishery." Journal of Applied Ecology.

Contact Michael.bode@qut.edu.au for support.

Fit_Bolbo_data.m is the central fitting file.

Assemble_distance_matrix.m must be run first to create the inter-reef distance matrix

Plot_kernel.m creates the dispersal kernel figure found in the article.
